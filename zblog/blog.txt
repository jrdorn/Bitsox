    1. initial business requirements => wireframes 

    2. components

    3. think of all the state needed to describe how app works
        describe UI with as few state values as possible
        app state (global, core data) and UI state (local, what the app is currently doing)
            local => if dropdown is open, current value of form input...

        design actions

        write root reducer combineReducers
            split reducer into slice reducers based on section of Redux state they update

        ajax calls to server/ async functions inside Redux thunks (dispatch and getState as args)
            loading state value to indicate current request status
            "request started" action before API call
            update loading state value when request completes

        react-router-dom


    Functionalities
        search
        select categories
        add/ remove items to cart 
        remove from inventory after purchase
        notifications to email

        smooth animations (dropdown menu, etc)

    Front-end
        Pages
            homepage
            individual item
            cart 
            checkout 
            login
                hooks:
                        When the form is submitted, you want to make an authentication request, fire off a call to your analytics tracker, make another call to logging software, dispatch some events, then redirect the user to a different page
                email
                facebook
                google
            user account
                view history
                store payment  
                change info
                    address
                    profile pic 
            signup
            help section
                link to buy crypto
                contact form 
            reviews
                reaction emojis
            list and sell your own items

            constant sidebar nav/ selectors, scrolling inventory


    Back-end 
        login/ logout
        handle payment 
        store inventory  
        state of cart
        JWT login


    Etc
        include ascii emoticons
        font line height
        write unit tests
            login
        accessible and responsive

|| General notes

React   
    sync state and ui 
    immutable state
    components
    controlled components
    virtual dom
    hooks instead of classes bit.ly/3FrDUhs
    useState, setState, useEffect, useReducer


Redux 
    central store holding entire app state
        each component can access any state from the store
        manage states shared across components 
        don't need to send props across components
        consistency across client, server, native env
    actions
        events that send data from app to store
        user events, api calls, form submissions
        store.dispatch()
        type and payload
    store
        only one per Redux app
        access
        update
        register/unregister listeners
    reducers
        current state => action => return new state object
        based on reduce(), single value calculated from many values after callback
    middleware
        e.g. sanitize login form input before sending to store

    standard patterns
        action creators 
        memoized selectors
        tracking request status via loading enums 
        normalizing state for managing item collections
        promises and thunks

...

React  
    reconciliation algorithm
        id minimal diff between trees to update the true dom
        minimize reflow and repaint
        O(n) compute tree diff 
            2 elements of diff types always produce 2 diff dom trees 
            signal stability of child components across render cycle by prodiving key props 
    virtual tree dom    
    200k in one sec 
    breadth first search

    renders all child components recursively by default, make sure not to re-render many components when nothing has changed
        wrap componets in React.memo(), so they only re-render when their props change

Redux   
    React state won't need to be lifted up 
    debugging, see what events cause a specific outcome  
    reducers are pure functions 
    immutable state => easier undo and redo
    predictable and maintanable 

    accidentally mutating state in reducers is most common Redux error
    action creators, createSlice and createAction can accept "prepare callback" that returns action payload

    call useSelector multiple times in one component, each call should return smallest ammount of state possible
    returning new array references in selectors causes components to re-render every time

React-Redux 
      shallowEqual checks if items inside array are still the same
      useSelector hook lets React components read data from Redux store
      useDispatch hook lets React components dispatch actions to Redux store

    action creator pattern-writing a function to prepare something that will get passed to dispatch

    Reselect library's createSelector API generates memoized selector functions
        only useful when you derive additional values from your original data

    store data in normalized state structure 

    useStore hook


Redux Toolkit
    createSlice
    createReducer
    createAsyncThunk    
    createEntityAdapter


Pure functions  
    no side effects
    if f() depends on vars outside itself, you don't know what will happen when you run it 
    if f() mods other vals, including args, it can unexpectedly change the way the app works

arrow functions and implicit return 

Memoized selectors, Reselect library, createSelector()

JS
    .map returns array, .reduce returns single output




entities: unique items with an ID 
enums - enumeration - named constants

handle API failures and other potential errors 

working with objects 
    ... spread operators, map(), keys() 
    destructuring - export const {todoAdded, todoToggled } = todosSlice.actions 

array.filter() element removal
