## Introduction

Bitsox is an ecommerce platform that accepts crypto in exchange for socks. Users may purchase socks, create and edit an account, view blog posts, receive regular email newsletters, and enter a contact form. Source code for the server and REST API can be found [here](https://github.com/jrdorn/bitsox-server).

I drew design inspiration for this project from Uniswap, Aave, and Polygon. I also drew layout inspiration from Amazon.
