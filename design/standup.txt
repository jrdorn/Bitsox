        Unexpected challenges?
            material design icons not rendering properly
            svg, png, CDN, self-hosting
            goal is smooth color transitions on hover

        Progress    
            Searchbar UI
            Filters UI 
            Deal UI
            Home grid layout

    What problems to solve 
        render material design icons
        Navbar 
        Item UI
        UI mock for About

    How to solve them
        CSS grid

    Prioritize
        Material design icons
        UI Components

    Potential roadblocks
        Material design implementation challenges (css/ js smooth animation)

    How to handle them
        Try each method (svg/png/cdn/self), if not a good fit then fall back to 
            text links or explore alternative icons

        Progress
            Searchbar: center, custom border on focus
            Navbar: sync route with buttons, Material UI icons, color scheme
            Lock Searchbar to top and Navbar to bottom of viewport

        Unexpected challenges?
            positioning logo and magnifying glass icon for responsive Searchbar 
            using tabs for Navbar: I want to use the indicator animation
                when switching tabs, but going to new route refreshes the page 

    What problems to solve 
        1. render different pages without refreshing the screen 
        2. finish UI mock components and complete responsive layout for Home, verify on multiple browsers 
        3. move on to About mock UI and other pages (should go much faster since the Common
            components, Searchbar and Navbar, will be done)

    How to solve them
        1. possibly abandon React-Router, except for pages that don't use Searchbar + Navbar 
            onClick [ Navbar element, inventory item ], change URL and change component display 
        2. production color scheme, and dummy box components that mimick production specs (e.g. boxes for inventory
            items that could be stored in MongoDB)
            verify against websites with quality design (Stackoverflow, Uniswap, Amazon)
        3. follow same patterns as Home mockup

    Potential roadblocks
        1. unforseen consequences of avoiding Router- keeping state together for multiple pages
        2. settling on an aesthetically pleasing layout for Searchbar, and implementing 
            logo and magnifying glass on top of fixed area  

    How to handle them
        1. update mental model - app as not just components that belong to pages, but sea of components 
            swimming together that are tied to each other by actions. So for the "pages" that will
            render by clicking Navbar tabs, the user will experience it as multiple pages, but they 
            could also be thought of as rendering a single page and swapping out some components for others 
        2. review inspiration sites, use devtools to see how they implemented their searchbars and top navbars
