        Unexpected challenges?
            material design icons not rendering properly
            svg, png, CDN, self-hosting
            goal is smooth color transitions on hover

        Progress    
            Searchbar UI
            Filters UI 
            Deal UI
            Home grid layout

    What problems to solve 
        render material design icons
        Navbar 
        Item UI
        UI mock for About

    How to solve them
        CSS grid

    Prioritize
        Material design icons
        UI Components

    Potential roadblocks
        Material design implementation challenges (css/ js smooth animation)

    How to handle them
        Try each method (svg/png/cdn/self), if not a good fit then fall back to 
            text links or explore alternative icons
